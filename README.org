* Typing Practise
A TUI typing practise application which can be run on arbitrary
files. This is *NOT* a trainer.

* Quick Start
- Depends on [[https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/][Ncurses]]

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/shoumodip/asdf
$ cd asdf
$ gcc -o asdf asdf.c -lncurses
$ ./asdf lorem.txt
#+end_src

* Usage
This application goes through the files in the command line arguments
one by one and makes the user practise on them.

#+begin_src console
$ asdf [FILES]
$ asdf lorem.txt asdf.c
#+end_src

There is no timer, no whiz-bang sound effects, no timers or
real-time WPM displayers, etc. The interface consists of just the text
and the cursor, nothing else. This provides for a distraction-free
typing environment.

On exiting the application or when the text it has been running on has
ended, your WPM and accuracy percentage is informed to you.

#+begin_src console
$ asdf lorem.txt
WPM: 149.94
Accuracy: 97.34
#+end_src
